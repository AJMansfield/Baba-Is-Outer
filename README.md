# Baba-Is-Outer
Outer Wilds inspired Baba Is You levelpack


## BABA ORBIT FLAG
This mod adds the verb "orbit" (and the counterpart "deorbit") that moves the first object around in a circle around the second object. This is fully integrated into BIY's movement system: while orbiting, baba will push, pull, be stopped, respond to locked, go to sleep, reverse, and and all the other word interactions you would expect. If there are multiple flags, Baba will orbit both of them. Multiple copies of the rule, and Baba orbits twice as fast. And if Baba and the flag both orbit each other, they'll actually orbit their mutual barycenter.
